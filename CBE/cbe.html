    <h1>What is CBE?</h1>
    <p>CBE is Competency Based Education. CBE focuses on Mastery of a subject/content, not time spent on the subject/content.</p>

    <h1>How does CBE work for...?</h1>
    <p>The number one thing to note about CBE is that it's not perfect. If CBE doesn't work for one skill, then don't apply it. <span class="big">CBE is flexible</span>. We use CBE where it counts.</p>
    <p>Please note: These are my notes/thoughts. Some of these come from thoughts I had, rather than content covered at the conference. For example, the note on adults making friends.</p>
    
    <h2><i>These are my takeaways from CBExchange 2024:</i></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>51% of Fortune 500 Companies have moved away from degree requirements...*<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*What this normally means is that they want a degree or equivalent field experience
        </li>
        <li>
            Up Skilling is growing in importance
        </li>
        <li>
            Connecting with K-12 can be a positive experience
        </li>
        <li>
            Can we connect with the National Governor's Association?
        </li>
        <li>
            Can we partner with CBEN?
        </li>
        <li>
            Over 9 million jobs are open in the US today
        </li>
        <li>
            Knowledge + Skill + Behavior + Application = Competency
        </li>
        <li>
            Assessment is critical
        </li>
        <li>
            Employers want graduates that can perform the job Day 1.
        </li>
        <li>
            Education is multi-sector: Education, Government, Industry, etc...
        </li>
        <li>
            Capella University offers CBE PhD programs...
        </li>
        <li>
            CBE benefits heavily from industry partnerships
        </li>
        <li>
            People are the biggest challenge for employers
        </li>
        <li>
            Currently the US is moving from a service based economy to a digital one. What are the implications of this?
        </li>
        <li>
            CBE should be equality focused.
        </li>
        <li>
            Underprivileged students have difficulty filling out forms - lack of time, access to info, don't fully understand what they're asking for, etc...
        </li>
        <li>
            We need to teach integrity with CBE
        </li>
        <li>
            We need all stakeholders at the table to move forward with education.
        </li>
        <li>
            Can we create more apprenticeships?
        </li>
        <li>
            Look into registered apprenticeships?
        </li>
        <li>
            Are there ways to teach/assess integrity aside from time? Some students are very busy. Families, jobs, etc. What other solutions do we have?
        </li>
        <li>
            Can we connect with more recruiters to make a pipeline for graduates?
        </li>
        <li>
            Employers want employees <span class="big">NOW</span>. Speed in education is valuable to employers, we stand a better chance at having more partnerships with CBE increasing the potential for speed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Keywords are important for resumes. Employers scan, they don't read. Can we find those skills/keywords and teach to them/tell students to put them on their resumes?
        </li>
        <li>
            Can we look into HR Management conferences/groups? Maybe learn their strategies to help our students become stronger candidates. SHRM is one.
        </li>
        <li>
            More open labs for networking?
        </li>
        <li>
            Have students work together more. They can teach/learn from each other, and develop soft skills this way.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create more open, equitable assessments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do assessments need to be in English? (Yes for programming. But maybe not for trades. Can they fix it? Can they weld it? If so, does the assessment need to be in English? Otherwise if the job requires English proficiency, it'll ask, and we don't need to teach it to certify their skills.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Compliance can be an impediment to CBE.
        </li>
        <li>
            CBE can be a different modality, and still fit into the semester model.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just do it - Pilot programs can prove efficacy.
        </li>
        <li>
            It's better to try and to fail, than to never try at all. Try a little bit of change, and if it doesn't work, go back. Some CBE is better than none.
        </li>
        <li>
            CBE holds students to higher standards. Probable that a "C" is not passing. We look for <strong class="big">mastery</strong> in CBE assessment.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pacing can be a challenge with CBE. Students need to be kept on track.
        </li>
        <li>
            Retention problems: Students don't have peers to help.
        </li>
        <li>
            1:1 Meetings should be done with new students. Even just short, 5 minute meetings with their advisor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Face to face should happen throughout the semester to help with retention.
        </li>
        <li>
            1st term is the biggest retention struggle
        </li>
        <li>
            Can we invite students to our department meetings? Maybe hosting a Q/A and open discussion session? Not everyone needs to be there, but maybe on occasion we could set aside times where we plan to have shared office hours/lab time/etc for students to approach us as a group if they need? We don't need to all be there every time, but is this an idea we are open to approaching?
        </li>
        <li>
            Can office hours be removed from workload? Students don't use them. Is there something more useful we could be doing instead?
        </li>
        <li>
            When meeting with CBE students, don't bother them for the timeline, ask them if there's any support you can offer. They'll be more open and less apprehensive to speak to us if we approach them to help, not to pressure them.
        </li>
        <li>
            CBE requires CBE coaches who understand the programs and can help students navigate competencies.
        </li>
        <li>
            Faculty contracts and workload definitely needs to be reworked for CBE.
        </li>
        <li>
            Team teaching? Multiple teachers in the same course? Shared courses?
        </li>
        <li>
            Assessment should be human centric. Try to really ask what bias assessment has and remove it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Momentum is important for getting students through school.
        </li>
        <li>
            How to help students make friends/build culture? We have a nation-wide issue where adults have difficulty making friends, forming relationships, and dating. I have personal experience with this, and have friends likewise that have this.
        </li>
        <li>
            Valid-8 is a tool to look at for Portfolios. (Note: This system is really cool. *I have more info about this, please ask me directly for it.)
        </li>
        <li>
            True portfolios as assessment.
        </li>
        <li>
            Behavioral, not demagraphic personas should be analyzed. Demographics are rooted in aspects that people can't change, and therefore create bias. Behavior groups help us classify students more fairly, while also accurately showing correlation and sometimes causation trends in data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Data can be Qualatative or Quantatative. Stories are important as well as stats. We want to be collecting personal experiences from our students and using those to guide us.
        </li>
        <li>
            Can we get the registrar to give all of the faculty an overview of how she would work with CBE on the enrollment side so we know what to plan for?
        </li>
        <li>
            CBE has no traditional grades, but special transcripts can be created upon request??? I don't know how this works, but I'd like to add it as a thinking point.
        </li>
        <li>
            Peer learning - authenticity, they also see problems they can relate to. It helps with their momentum/confidence to see that others are having similar issues.
        </li>
        <li>
            Momentum = Confidence, and Confidence = Momentum.
        </li>
        <li>
            Confidence is huge. Confident students will try harder, and go further.
        </li>
        <li>
            We should have models of what a successful outcome looks like. For example, in CIS 195 we have the website projects. We've created sites for students to go play with and view to see an example of what a successful website would look like.
        </li>
        <li>
            Distinguish stats between students that started with CBE, and students who went from traditional to CBE. This can have an effect on outcomes, and so we shouldn't use it to judge pure CBE outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Traditional students/alumni peform poorly in a CBE environment.
        </li>
        <li>
            Need to focus on onboarding. (in what way did I mean this?)
        </li>
        <li>
            Microcredentials create momentum.
        </li>
        <li>
            WGU Acheivement Wallet...
        </li>
        <li>
            WGU Wallet hooks into job listings, helps build resumes based on keywords from job listings, looks at competencies students have earned and helps bridge and integrate between these. Some competencies will have multiple associated skills, or might have multiple names that mean the same thing. The keywords/language can be adjusted to fit resumes to jobs. (Similar to Valid-8... I have more info on this as well...)
        </li>
        <li>
            Upskilling is cheaper than hiring new staff (entry level or not.)
        </li>
        <li>
            There are tax credits for adult learners??? (All of us instructors can use them as well, if we have continuing education)
        </li>
        <li>
            Average person changes jobs 12 times in their life.
        </li>
        <li>
            Utilize AI to create simulated internships/clients?
        </li>
        <li>
            Have students interview people in industry.
        </li>
        <li>
            Can we partner with places to get mini internships for students to build websites/apps? Maybe unpaid, community service, etc? This would be good resume experience, as it is an internship.
        </li>
        <li>
            Information Analyst positions are expected to grow by 32%. (Data science degree?)
        </li>
        <li>
            PACE program for Cyber???
        </li>
        <li>
            Upskill K-12 teachers? Upskill higher ed instructors?
        </li>
        <li>
            Can we upskill in basic Computing/Cyber Security? This can benefit any job.
        </li>
        <li>
            Everyone in careers from any industry should be Language Literate, Tech Literate, and now AI Literate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Seminary schools are looking at ordination as a CBE process... there is so much more that we can turn into CBE skills...
        </li>
        <li>
            Self driven assessment can help drive passion.
        </li>
        <li>
            Passion can drive a student to do better.
        </li>
        <li>
            The seminary session had them talking about "Ordain, then Train". Students would be ordained, then trained further while they worked in the church. Similarly, I think it would be beneficial to find a way to get students into jobs early, and have them upskill.
        </li>
        <li>
            More PLAs (Prior Learning Assessments)/CPLs (Credit for Prior Learning).
        </li>
        <li>
            Having a communication plan is critical to change. *More on this later. Effective communication is necessary, and not always obvious how to do so...
        </li>
        <li>
            Look at how language learning can impact education...
        </li>
        <li>
            VISION is necessary for change.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adversity helps train - Give faulty basis, have students learn what to avoid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Poor communication leads to rumors. Rumors are almost impossible to dispel completely.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let stakeholders know the issues you're having, even if you don't have solutions. Transparency is critical to trust and communication.
        </li>
        <li>
            Physical messages/memos are extremely effective at getting attention. (mostly for on campus)
        </li>
        <li>
            Communicate multiple times - People might miss emails/not check things.
        </li>
        <li>
            Digital fluency, not just understanding.
        </li>
    </ul>
