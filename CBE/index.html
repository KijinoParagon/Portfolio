      <h1>What is CBE?</h1>
      <p>CBE is <a href="#competency">Competency</a> Based Education. CBE focuses on Mastery of a subject/content, not time spent on the subject/content.</p>
      <h1>How does CBE work for...?</h1>
      <p>The number one thing to note about CBE is that it's not perfect. If CBE doesn't work for one skill, then don't apply it. <span class="big">CBE is flexible</span>. We use CBE where it counts. </p>
      <p>Please note: These are my notes/thoughts. Some of these come from thoughts I had, rather than content covered at the conference. For example, the note on adults making friends.</p>

        <h2><i>These are my takeaways from CBExchange 2024:</i></h2>
        <h1>Trends in Employment & Education Requirements</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Shifts in Degree Requirements: 51% of Fortune 500 Companies have reduced degree requirements, seeking either degrees or equivalent experience.</li>
          <li>Competency-Based Education (CBE) Demand: CBE benefits heavily from <span class="big">industry partnerships</span>, and employers desire graduates who can perform on <span class="big">Day 1.</span>
          </li>
          <li>Economic Shift: The US is transitioning from a service-based to a digital economy, with implications for education and workforce readiness.</li>
          <li><a href="#upskill">Upskilling</a> Priority: <span class="big"><a href="#upskill">Upskilling</a></span> is crucial and often more cost-effective than hiring new employees. </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Competency-Based Education (CBE) Model</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Core Components: <span class="big"><a href="#competency">Competency</a></span> = Knowledge + Skill + Behavior + Application. </li>
          <li>CBE Structure: Non-traditional grading; focuses on mastery (e.g., a "C" may not be passing).</li>
          <li>Human-Centered Assessment: CBE assessments should <span class="big">minimize bias</span> and be focused on actual skills and competencies. </li>
          <li>Equity and Accessibility: CBE should aim to be inclusive, offering equitable assessments and focusing on underprivileged students' needs.</li>
          <li>Challenges in CBE: Retention, pacing, faculty workload, compliance, and peer support.</li>
          <li><a href="#cbecoach">CBE Coaching</a>: Faculty should act as <a href="#cbecoach">CBE coaches</a>, providing guidance on competencies rather than strict timelines.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Partnerships and Collaboration</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Potential Partnerships: Explore partnerships with the National Governor's Association, CBEN, recruiters, and industries to create a graduate pipeline.</li>
          <li>Industry Interaction: Connecting with industry leaders, HR conferences (e.g., SHRM), and involving <span class="big">recruiters</span> for stronger student-industry alignment. </li>
          <li>K-12 Engagement: Collaborate with K-12 education to build early positive connections.</li>
          <li>Apprenticeships: Develop more apprenticeships, including <span class="strong"><a href="#registeredapprenticeship"></a>registered apprenticeships</a></span>, to enhance skill development and job readiness. </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Student Support and Retention</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Building Relationships: <span class="big"><a href="#peerlearning">Peer learning</a></span>, group projects, and open labs can help foster soft skills and connections. </li>
          <li>1:1 Meetings and Face-to-Face Interactions: Regular check-ins with new students can improve retention.</li>
          <li>Support and Flexibility: Approaching students with offers of support rather than focusing on deadlines encourages openness and comfort.</li>
          <li>Cultural and Social Development: Encourage <span class="big">community</span> to address social isolation issues among adults. </li>
          <li>Student Engagement in Departmental Activities: Look to possibly involve students in departmental meetings for more transparency and interaction. This may be a</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Assessment and Skill Validation</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Portfolio-Based Assessment: Tools like Valid-8 can be used to evaluate student portfolios as authentic assessments.</li>
          <li>Assessing Beyond Traditional Metrics: Behavior-based personas over demographics; <span class="big">stories</span> (qualitative data) along with stats are valuable. </li>
          <li>Language Accessibility in Assessment: Consider non-English assessments for trades where language may not impact job performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Technological Integration and Innovation</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Digital Tools: Utilize AI for simulated internships, <a href="#competency">competency</a> mapping tools like the WGU Achievement Wallet for resume building.</li>
          <li>Simulated Experiences: Create virtual internships or interview projects with industry representatives to help students gain experience.</li>
          <li>
            <span class="big"><a href="#microcredential">Microcredentials</a></span>: <a href="#microcredential">Microcredentials</a> can increase momentum by showcasing specific skill achievements.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Faculty and Program Development</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Workload and Contract Revisions: Faculty workload models need adjustments for CBE, potentially including team teaching.</li>
          <li>Office Hours: Due to the more flexible nature of CBE, set office hours become less valuable, as student needs will shift.</li>
          <li>Experimental Approach: Run <span class="big">pilot programs</span> to test efficacy, with openness to iterative change. </li>
          <li>Onboarding Focus: Smooth onboarding is essential, especially as students transition from traditional to CBE programs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Competency-Based Education Challenges</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Compliance: Regulatory compliance may limit flexibility in CBE programs.</li>
          <li>Job Market Readiness: Emphasize <span class="big">resume</span> keyword relevance to match employer scanning practices. </li>
          <li>Momentum and Confidence: <span class="big">Momentum</span> boosts confidence, which in turn fuels student persistence in programs. </li>
          <li>Skill Gaps in Digital Literacy: Basic computing and cybersecurity skills are valuable across industries, alongside written/spoken language and AI literacy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Future Program Opportunities</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Specific Programs: Explore PACE programs for Cybersecurity, language, and AI literacy.</li>
          <li>Faculty and K-12 Teacher <a href="#upskill">Upskilling</a>: Provide <a href="#upskill">upskilling</a> for educators to maintain relevance with emerging digital competencies.</li>
          <li>Information Analyst Growth: <span class="big">Information Analyst</span> roles are expected to grow significantly; consider data science-oriented programming for this need. </li>
